I‚Äôll structure this into phases. Each phase has:

Concept (with analogy) ‚Üí what/why in plain terms

Questions to answer ‚Üí to test understanding

Labs (hands-on tasks) ‚Üí what you‚Äôll build/do

Deliverable ‚Üí GitHub-worthy artifact

üöÄ DevOps Learning Plan
Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Infrastructure (Week 1‚Äì2)
Concept (Analogy)

Think of AWS like a city.

VPC = your gated neighborhood

Subnets = the streets inside

EC2 = houses you rent (servers)

Security Groups = who‚Äôs allowed to knock on the door

IAM = your house keys and who gets them

Questions

Why isolate workloads into VPCs instead of throwing everything in ‚Äúdefault‚Äù?

What problem does IAM solve compared to just SSH keys?

Why use security groups instead of just opening ports on EC2?

Labs

Create a VPC, subnet, IGW, route table.

Launch an EC2 instance (t2.micro) inside it.

SSH with keypair, deploy Nginx, and serve a static HTML page.

Tear it down with a Bash script (teardown.sh).

Deliverable

Repo: aws-bootcamp-day1-ec2

Includes: commands.sh, teardown.sh, README.md (diagram + explanation).

Phase 2 ‚Äì Automation Foundations (Week 2‚Äì3)
Concept (Analogy)

Manual clicks are like cooking without recipes. IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is the recipe card: repeatable, shareable, testable.

Questions

Why is IaC better than manual setup?

Difference between Terraform and CloudFormation?

What happens if Terraform state is corrupted?

Labs

Re-create your EC2 setup from Phase 1 using Terraform.

Parameterize it (variables for region, instance type).

Use terraform plan ‚Üí apply ‚Üí destroy.

Store Terraform state in S3 (backend config).

Deliverable

Repo: infra-as-code-terraform-ec2

Contains .tf files, diagrams, and README.md explaining state.

Phase 3 ‚Äì CI/CD Pipelines (Week 3‚Äì4)
Concept (Analogy)

A CI/CD pipeline is like an assembly line in a factory:

CI (Continuous Integration) = workers test each part as it comes in.

CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) = conveyor belt delivers final product to customers automatically.

Questions

Why is automated testing before deployment critical?

What‚Äôs the difference between GitHub Actions vs Jenkins?

Why use containers (Docker) in pipelines?

Labs

Dockerize a Python Flask app.

Push image to DockerHub or ECR.

Build GitHub Actions pipeline:

On push, run tests

Build image

Deploy to EC2 via SSH

Bonus: Jenkins pipeline with the same flow.

Deliverable

Repo: flask-ci-cd-pipeline

Includes Dockerfile, github-actions.yml, Jenkinsfile.

Phase 4 ‚Äì Observability & Monitoring (Week 4‚Äì5)
Concept (Analogy)

Running services without monitoring is like flying a plane without gauges. You need dashboards, alerts, and logs to ‚Äúsee‚Äù your system‚Äôs health.

Questions

Difference between monitoring vs observability?

Why store logs centrally instead of per server?

What is the purpose of health checks in load balancers?

Labs

Deploy Prometheus + Grafana on EC2 (monitor CPU, memory).

Add alerts for high CPU (>70%).

Ship Nginx logs to CloudWatch or ELK stack.

Deliverable

Repo: aws-monitoring-lab

Includes Grafana dashboards (JSON export), docker-compose.yml, and config files.

Phase 5 ‚Äì Scaling & Reliability (Week 6‚Äì7)
Concept (Analogy)

A single EC2 is like a street food cart. Scaling is building multiple carts across the city, with a traffic cop (load balancer) directing customers.

Questions

Why use ALB (Application Load Balancer) vs ELB?

What problem do Auto Scaling Groups solve?

What‚Äôs the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?

Labs

Deploy Flask app to an Auto Scaling Group (min=2, max=4).

Put ALB in front.

Stress test with ab or wrk.

Observe scaling in/out.

Deliverable

Repo: scaling-flask-alb-asg

Includes Terraform configs + stress test results.

Phase 6 ‚Äì Advanced DevOps Scenarios (Week 8‚Äì10)
Concept (Analogy)

Senior engineers don‚Äôt just ‚Äúbuild servers‚Äù ‚Äî they design resilient systems that survive failure.

Scenarios to Tackle

Blue/Green & Canary deployments

Secrets management (Vault/SSM)

Disaster recovery (backup & restore)

Debugging: why is the pipeline failing? why is app unreachable?

Labs

Implement Blue/Green deployment with CodeDeploy.

Store secrets in AWS SSM Parameter Store (no hardcoded keys).

Simulate failure: kill an EC2 in ASG, verify self-healing.

Debug a broken CI pipeline and document fixes.

Deliverable

Repo: advanced-devops-labs

Each scenario in its own folder with README.md writeup.

üìà Progression Recap

Phase 1‚Äì2 ‚Üí Core infra + automation (get servers running, scripted, repeatable)

Phase 3‚Äì4 ‚Üí Pipelines + monitoring (code flows automatically, metrics/logs visible)

Phase 5 ‚Üí Scaling (high availability, load balancers, ASGs)

Phase 6 ‚Üí Senior-level scenarios (resilience, deployments, debugging)
